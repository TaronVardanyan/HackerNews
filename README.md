# HackerNews

> **Important**

I'm going to build a simple clone of Hackernews. Here’s a list of the features the app will have:

Display a list of links
Search the list of links
Handle user authentication
Allow authenticated users to create new links
Allow authenticated users to upvote links (one vote per link and user)
Realtime updates when other users upvote a link or create a new one
In this track, we’ll use the following technologies for building the app:

Frontend:

React: Library for building user interfaces
Apollo Client 3.2: Production-ready, caching GraphQL client
Backend:

Apollo Server 2.18: Fully-featured GraphQL Server with focus on easy setup, performance and great developer experience
Prisma: Open-source database toolkit that makes it simple to work with relational databases
We’ll create the React project with create-react-app, a popular command-line tool that gives us a blank project with all required build configuration already setup.
