# HackerNews

I'm going to build a simple clone of Hackernews. Here’s a list of the features the app will have:

Display a list of links
Search the list of links
Handle user authentication
Allow authenticated users to create new links
Allow authenticated users to upvote links (one vote per link and user)
Realtime updates when other users upvote a link or create a new one
In this track, we’ll use the following technologies for building the app:

Frontend:

React: Library for building user interfaces
Apollo Client 3.2: Production-ready, caching GraphQL client
Backend:

Apollo Server 2.18: Fully-featured GraphQL Server with focus on easy setup, performance and great developer experience
Prisma: Open-source database toolkit that makes it simple to work with relational databases
We’ll create the React project with create-react-app, a popular command-line tool that gives us a blank project with all required build configuration already setup.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
